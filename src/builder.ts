/*
    Name - Builder
    Type - Creational Patterns

    Description - In classes that have a lot of fields you oftentimes end up with many constructors 
    as you might need objects using different field combinations. The Builder pattern enables a more 
    readable object creation and letâ€™s you specify the fields that are actually needed. In the example 
    below a DataFetcher object can be created by passing the fields that are needed in a specific case. 
    This also makes the code more readable, while only one constructor is needed.
